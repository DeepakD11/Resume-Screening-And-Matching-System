### Project Description
This project is a resume screening and matching system built with applications of Gen AI and NLP . It allows the HR of a company to upload resumes (in PDF or DOCX format) of the candidates, extract key data (such as skills, qualifications, and experience), and compare them to a given job description to rank candidates based on their relevance to the role.
